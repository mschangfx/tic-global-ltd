## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Firebase is not configured"**
   - Check that all 6 environment variables are set correctly
   - Restart your development server after updating `.env.local`
   - Verify the Firebase project is active

2. **"Invalid phone number format"**
   - Ensure phone numbers include country code (e.g., +639123456789)
   - Use international format with + prefix

3. **"Too many requests"**
   - Firebase has rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Wait a few minutes before trying again
   - Consider adding test phone numbers for development

4. **"reCAPTCHA verification failed"**
   - Make sure your domain is added to authorized domains
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Ensure reCAPTCHA is not blocked by ad blockers

5. **SMS not received**
   - Check Firebase Console → Authentication → Usage for delivery status
   - Verify the phone number is correct and can receive SMS
   - Some carriers may have delays
